			This past weekend, I went to the English countryside to celebrate my daughter‚Äôs 18th birthday at Cliveden House.  I planned, planned, and planned some more, making multiple phone calls and sending emails verifying that the hotel was accessible and that I could get to my room, the restaurants, and various other parts of the hotel in an accessible way.  I have started to ask if hotels are  ‚Äúwheelchair accessible‚Äù even though I don‚Äôt often need to use one, as it usually results in a place that I can genuinely navigate.  It is essential to be as specific as possible (I‚Äôve found out the hard way) to avoid disappointment at the hands of the non-disabled reservations staff that can‚Äôt understand why walking down a hallway that is 50 meters long is harder for some people or impossible, than others.
			<br>
			We pulled up to the hotel on a long GRAVEL driveway.  After driving and sitting for more than an hour, I needed to use my rollator that turns into a wheelchair, and as many of us know, wheelchairs and gravel do not get along very well.  Just to get into the hotel, it was a struggle, and then they brought out a wobbly ramp to get up the few stairs into the lobby.  Because of COVID, the porter insisted that we use the hand sanitizing station that my wheelchair couldn‚Äôt reach, even though I had my own, and we were off to a difficult start.  My patient and darling husband then had to play Sisyphos (you know, the man in Greek mythology,  pushing the boulder uphill just to have it roll down when he is almost at the top) in getting the wheelchair up the decades-old ramp with another ungainly shove.  Next was the elevator the size of a dumbwaiter that required my husband to go forward and back and forward and back just to get into it and a big, unceremonious ‚Äúheave-ho‚Äù to get me in far enough for the doors to close.  It was the same exercise getting out on the first floor, only to be repeated every time we left our room.  I‚Äôm quite certain that not too many women like the idea of being ‚ÄúHeave Ho‚Äôd‚Äù around.  I know I don‚Äôt. GRRRR
			<br>
			Our room was nice enough. We had certainly paid out the nose for the suite that had a walk-in shower and fireplace and a beautiful view of the grounds of the historic house that once hosted the parties of the Astor‚Äôs and various other celebrities and royals over the decades.  This charm was largely lost on me.  I was furious that what I had imagined as a relaxing weekend, after months and months of being locked in from COVID, when I finally had a chance to enjoy my daughter‚Äôs 18th birthday, I was left a frazzled and traumatized wreck before the fun even started.  
			<br>
			After a pre-dinner meltdown, I managed to pull it together and have a lovely time with my daughter and husband.  We had dinner at the hotel‚Äôs dining room (another chance for the hotel to win me over, blown out like the candles on the birthday cake), and then opened presents upstairs.  She was thrilled and happy, and so were we, for those few hours when we were safely ensconced in our room.
			<br>
			The next morning, after a breakfast that lacked any semblance of a five-star experience (no butter or jam for the toast, no lemon for the tea, no sugar, no sides for the smoked salmon) Hell, we were lucky that we got a plate!  After meltdown number two in 24 hours, we decided.  We are going to CUT OUR LOSSES!  There were still 30 hours of the weekend left, and by god, even though we had paid in advance and were worried about our daughter and her friends being upset that we were leaving, we left, with the same struggle with which we arrived.  We went home, ordered sushi, and watched our favorite TV show, pandemic style.  Yes, we had spent a considerable sum on this particular place, but our peace of mind and hours left in the day were more important to us.  We could have struggled through several more trips in the horrendous elevator, eating lousy food, and could have endured the rickety ramp and sagging floors for another day. Still, we decided we would be happier at home, AND WE WERE.
			<br>
			My meltdowns, for the record, are usually frustration based.  I‚Äôm not one for pity parties, although to be sure, they are sometimes incredibly well-deserved. üôÇ
			<br>
			This experience left me with some truths that I‚Äôd like to share:
			<ol>
				<li>
					Lovely experiences should not be only for non-disabled people.  As a person that has been both in my fifty-two years, I am well aware of what a weekend in the country should be like for everyone; relaxing, fun, a change of scenery, and the access that allows EVERYONE to go to the pool, the spa, the gym, the restaurant.  Cliveden House is not this in any way, even though the staff represented that they were fully accessible.  They even compared themselves to their sister hotel, Chewton Glen, as far superior in all ways and especially access.  I did not find this to be the case.  They are both terribly inaccessible unless you have a sprained wrist as your biggest issue.
				</li>
				<li>
					It is not your fault.  Whether you put in hours of planning or not, hotels, points of interest, museums, schools, restaurants, and so on should be accessible for everyone.  When these places fail, they should feel bad for their guests.  They should be going above and beyond as hoteliers, restauranteurs, etc.  None of us asked to have mobility challenges, and it can happen to anyone, so putting some thought into access is just good karma.
				</li>
				<li>
					Having a disability should not make you the center of attention.  I just wanted to go out and celebrate a big milestone with my family.  Crying all of my makeup off 5 minutes before our reservation was not fun, nor is it acceptable that I was made to feel like an encumbrance and a ‚Äúspecial situation‚Äù.  This lack of access is why so many people with disabilities just stay home.  When you, as a valuable customer, aren‚Äôt treated the same as others, it is maddening and frustrating and, frankly, a waste of money.  Take that, economy!  I‚Äôm not contributing unless my access is GUARANTEED.
				</li>
				<li>
					There is no guarantee of getting your money back, but by god, you can try.  We left without contacting the manager and complaining or looking for another solution, and unfortunately, this is very commonly the situation for customers  leaving because of ‚Äúaccess ‚Äú issues.  I was so on the edge of crying the whole time I was there that it just wasn‚Äôt worth it at the time.  I was so disappointed and felt so unconsidered that I couldn‚Äôt see the point clearly at the time.  I will, however, follow up with the general manager of Cliveden House to his private email.  I am not one for bashing businesses on TripAdvisor, and the like before I give companies the chance to redeem themselves in private.  I would also not hesitate, however, to honestly rate the hotel‚Äôs access issues on Access Rating,https://www.accessrating.com,  the app in the UK that will help prevent this kind of a disappointment for you and your fellow travelers.
