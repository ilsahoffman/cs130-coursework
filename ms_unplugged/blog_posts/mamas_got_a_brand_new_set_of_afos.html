			Well, if you asked me what on Earth? these things were just a few short months ago, I would have had no idea! This is my new set of Ankle Foot Orthotics, better known in the MS community as AFOs, and they are meant to retrain my legs to walk properly and to keep me from tripping over my own right foot. For the past few years, I have walked with a wild swing on my right side, so instead of walking by bending my knee and engaging my core and gluteus medius, I have instead swung my straight leg around in order to compensate for muscle weakness and foot drop caused by a neurological deficit and have developed a sub-optimal way of walking that only makes the situation worse. I have also been a devotee of wall and furniture surfing, which is all fine and good, as long as you donâ€™t grab onto a swivel chair and land in a pile of luggage, or something with wheels (like my desk chair) and end up slamming your head on the marble top and giving yourself a concussion! Yes, these examples are way too specific to be made up ðŸ™‚ My AFOs are custom carbon fiber, but there are many on the market that do basically the same thing if you can get them to fit properly. I needed custom ones because I am also hyper mobile and my knee on the same right side likes to hyper extend, just to make the whole walking thing all the more challenging. They gave me a little hinge on each one to bend my knee properly forward instead of backward and so far, while it is really difficult to learn to do things the correct way, I at least feel that I am moving in the right direction.
			<br>
			So there are two things Iâ€™m wondering about:
			<br>
			Why didnâ€™t someone recommend these sooner? I have two amazing neurologists, two neuro physio-therapists and nurses galore and noone ever mentioned this as an option. I know they arenâ€™t going to fix my MS, but they sure enable me to stay on my feet longer and my walking, which had become downright dangerous, was only getting worse, not better. I had to find an orthotics company myself and just chance it that they would help and that it wasnâ€™t just a gimmick.
			<br>
			Why canâ€™t they be prettier? When I requested a nude color, I had no idea that they would be more orange than pasty white and the black straps basically entirely keep them from blending in, even if I was the somewhat Trumpian color of orange that they are. That leads me next to the shoes! AAAGH. I can honestly say that I have never seen an uglier pair of shoes, but because the AFOs are so bulky, they absolutely wonâ€™t fit in any of my own shoes, so for now, I only wear these when Iâ€™m training my legs, or walking in front of my house. I know it sounds vain, but I am trying really hard to maintain some level of mojo in life. Maybe I will get over this, maybe not, but for now this is my plan. I wear the more discreet foot-drop AFOs when I go out The shoes are also extremely heavy. The benefit of them is that my legs feel as light as a feather when I take them off and I think it makes my walking easier. Maybe that is part of the grand plan, but Iâ€™m not too sure about that!
			<br>
			So, I highly recommend AFOs if foot drop is your problem. There are so many options to choose from and one of my favorite AFO gurus is Lainie at Trendable https://trend-able.com Her site is amazing and shows you that you can maintain some sense of fashion fabulousness with AFOs on board and after all, besides trying to function better, I believe all of us just want to feel as normal as possible and carry on with life.
