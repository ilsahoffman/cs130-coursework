			I first heard about Magnesium Cream while getting a massage with the incredible Terese Whitley  http://teresewhitley.com. (LUCKY YOU if you are near Jacksonville, Florida and can make an appointment with her!) Terese is one of those “once in a lifetime” body work professionals that you wish you could take with you everywhere you go for the rest of your life.  My particular problem was MS spasticity in my right calf and quadricep. While this stuff she used is a little thick, mixed with a small amount of essential oils, it was exactly the right consistency.
			<br>
			For those of us with digestive issues and malabsorption of vitamins, I find this an amazing way to get your needed magnesium transdermally. It basically does the same thing as an Epsom salt bath, but without the hot water and all related symptoms if you are heat sensitive.  I find this website quite good at explaining the whole thing https://www.ancient-minerals.com/transdermal-magnesium/, so I won’t bother re-inventing the wheel. Ancient Minerals is also a very highly rated seller of these products, if you’re interested!
