			I woke up this morning, determined not to listen to the voice of self-doubt that plagued me all day yesterday.  I did about ten things for other people, didn’t exercise, didn’t eat much of anything all day and then had tacos for dinner.  Yeah, it was pretty much the opposite of the goals I have set for myself. I didn’t even take my vitamins!
			<br>
			Today, as I was getting ready, I was trying to think of how exactly I want to define myself and words like caring, empathetic, generous, brave and badass all came to mind and I wonder if there is a way for these qualities to work together? Before my last MS attack, I was also thinking it would be nice to age with a kind of Audrey Hepburn kind of grace, which given my serious limp and balance issues..the visual just doesn’t quite work.
			<br>
			I think I have gotten the caring, empathetic and generous down, however that usually meant that I was all of these things by often sacrificing myself.  No-one else put that on me, I did it to myself. I think it stems from not feeling as worthy myself as the other people I was nurturing and loving, who I would literally do anything for.
			<br>
			Clearly,  the brave and badass are where I have been lacking.
			<br>
			I think it takes a lot of strength and bravery to tell others  you need to help yourself first. That, no, you can’t go out for the third night in a row to celebrate their something or other, that you need to go to bed early and get a good night’s rest so that you have the energy to work out the next day and be the best version of badass that you can be.  This cycle of putting everyone else’s needs before my own has left me depleted. A good friend (who doesn’t have MS) told me that her “soul is tired” and I understood entirely what she meant. The funny thing is that the people closest to me entirely support the idea of me doing things for myself, but for some reason I have not taken it on.  Oh, I plan and read and dream of how to change these less-than-ideal habits, but I stumble when it come to follow through.
			<br>
			So today, I’m off to the salon(a little shallow I know, but I can’t do anything with bad hair!)  to fix the outside and will continue to work on the most important challenge of fixing the inside.  I’ve always worked well with to-do lists and the days that I am most happy with have always included personal to-dos like working out, meditating, writing and taking care of my own needs before I do anything else.
			<br>
			I’ve worked out, I’ve stretched (pre-salon)  so I’m off to a good start, how about you?
