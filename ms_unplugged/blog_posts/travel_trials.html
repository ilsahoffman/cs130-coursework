			I have been lucky enough to travel all over the world.  My fascination started when I was working in the Fashion industry in my 20’s and then continued as my husband and our family moved to London and Tokyo and then back to London again.  Sometimes I traveled alone, but much of the time I was traveling with my gaggle of lovelies and strollers, suitcases, car seats (well you get the picture) on international flights and I LOVED every minute.  The chaos of it all was fun and made for great stories. This is all while I had quiet MS…I could still do everything I wanted and there was no downside to the over-doing it, the stress and the jet lag…SIMPLE.
			<br>
			But now, just when I thought it would all be easier (my children are now 22, 19, 17 and 15) I can barely drag myself through the easiest of airports on the shortest of flights without serious problems like legs that seize up and swerve and my complete inability to carry anything (it throws off my balance).  Independent travel has always been important to me and now I find myself completely at the mercy of whoever has been allocated to help me, and then the real problems start when they don’t show up!
			<br>
			My last flight from Montreal to London, I decided to leave my Rollz (https://rollz.com/en/rollators/rollz-motion/) at home.  I was coming back in a few weeks anyway and it would be difficult for me to manage getting from the gate at Heathrow, through customs and baggage and out to the taxi stand. In Montreal, when I mentioned to the British Airways Agent that I had requested wheelchair assistance, he said “Are you sure you need it?  If so, you can stand over there by the locked wheelchairs and someone will probably be there in 45 MINUTES”. I was shocked by his complete lack of empathy. People don’t request wheelchairs so that they can STAND and wait for them. There were no chairs at all next to the wheelchairs either. Not a good sign. My husband and I decided we would break out my cane and try to hobble through security and then to the gate.  It was not pretty.
			<br>
			Did I mention that I had been abandoned in the British Airways lounge a few weeks before that?  I was the last person on the plane because the person with the electric cart had too many passengers that day.  Thank you British Aviation Authority, NOT.
			<br>
			I’m not sure if this has happened to any of you, but once I started using mobility aids, it struck me how many of us there really are.  I suddenly started noticing canes, walkers, and wheelchairs and the PEOPLE that were using them. This leads me to the point that I think is of the utmost importance!  If we hope to live as normally as possible, we need the world to start caring about how people with injuries and mobility challenges are going to get around. Most people will have some challenge at some point in their lives and the airline, restaurant or business that doesn’t get around to making their business accessible not only hurts those with challenges, but their business,as well.  There are laws (some quite lax and obscure) about accessibility and it makes me really, really MAD when airlines, for instance, through a complete lack of concern and responsibility to their passengers, leave them STRANDED.
			<br>
			So WHAT CAN WE DO?  Complain. OFFICIALLY.  Write letters, leave reviews, tell the world how you have been treated.  Access should be for everyone. Don’t let the apathy of these businesses make you stay home or become INVISIBLE.  Do what you do, it helps all of us!
			<br>
			On that note, I would also advise you to plan for a worst-case scenario.  I’ve just purchased another mobility aid (https://www.byacre.com/) that will be easier for me to manage when my gaggle of lovelies isn’t  present. Make sure you understand how the mobility assistance works and leave plenty of time for error and raising HELL, if need be!  I’ll keep you posted on how successful opening up the can of Whoop-Ass is. x
