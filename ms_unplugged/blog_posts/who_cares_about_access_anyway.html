		<h2>
			Who Cares About Access Anyway? (Hint: Everyone)

			This question comes to mind after spending the last several months trying desperately to keep up with my formerly globe-trotting, foodie and fun-loving ways and finding myself in a heap of exhaustion and near tears one too many times.  Needless to say, this strange body that I have found myself in (rather suddenly) is not buying in to the ways of the past and I have been forced to consider and think about Access with a capital “A”, as it is obvious that all of the things I have taken for granted as far as getting in and around and up and down are now a challenge.  I don’t know if this challenge will stay with me forever, but I do know, that the awareness that I have gained from observing the world from a wheelchair has changed me for good.
			<br>
			I had never actually thought about how people with disabilities navigate the world.  It was easy to look past someone with a cane or wheelchair and not consider the real struggle that was affecting them in every simple way imaginable.  Those stairs leading up to their favorite neighborhood restaurant or the dock that used to be a leisurely walk through the trees becomes has become a barrier to whatever experience is available to every able-bodied person.
			<br>
			I feel bad about this. My cluelessness was not malicious.  I was busy with my own life, my own family, my own little bubble.
			<br>
			My son is a rower.  He has rowed at the Head of the Charles Regatta for the past two years and our family has always enjoyed going to his races and cheering him on.  In 2016, when my symptoms were first beginning, the endless walking to and from the course was surprisingly exhausting and left me feeling emotionally drained.  I couldn’t seem to keep up with everyone. I just felt like sitting down. I was snappy and felt like staying at the hotel.
			<br>
			Fast forward a year, and I had figured out that I had experienced a nasty MS relapse without fully recognizing it and had come to accept that all of the walking required  for watching my son race would require more help than just my sweet husband’s arm. I resisted using an electric scooter, or a cane, or crutches or nordic walking poles. Somehow it felt like a defeat and I wasn’t really happy about accepting my predicament.  In the end, I decided the electric scooter would help me to actually enjoy myself and allow me the emotional energy to be fun to be with and not a sweaty, sobbing train wreck. So while the scooter did require some getting used to, it did the trick. Until the battery gave out.  I had to walk (more like hobble) and my husband and son had to push the heavy electric contraption back to the hotel (lucky we weren’t too far) and find out why the concierge hadn’t charged it. Well, the reason was, HE HADN’T THOUGHT ABOUT IT. Just as I would not have thought about it until I needed it and this is my point.
			<br>
			I feel that it is important not to blame others for not understanding disabilities.  No one realizes how quickly you can become invisible to the able-bodied. How they don’t understand why you are being a pest when your wheelchair hasn’t arrived 30 minutes before you need to be at your gate for a flight, why you grimace at the doormen of a hotel that has 20 steps leading to the front door and the accessible elevator at street level isn’t working.  
			<br>
			So who should care about Access?  Everyone, but using myself as an example of a nice person living in complete oblivion, I feel that all of us that need access, need to educate and make our friends, family, airlines, airports, restaurants, hotels, towns and government aware when something isn’t right or when something is broken and  it is preventing us from living our lives to the fullest.
