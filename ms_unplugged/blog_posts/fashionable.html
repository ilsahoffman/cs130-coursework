			This post is all about my quest to stay fashionable with all of the lovely symptoms that go along with my MS.  I’ve seen many other MSers bemoan the loss of high heels (or shall I say, being able to walk in high heels) but I want to dig in a little here.
			<br>
			I will never forget walking into a lovely lunch at one of my friend’s home in suburban London.  I was new to London, new to this group (at least some of them) and clearly was dressed very wrong for the occasion.  I have to say, that it was a miracle that I got myself out of the house that pretty Autumn day, but I did…lipstick, blow dry, cashmere wrap, stylish jeans and “GONG” (for any of you who remember the Gong Show) SNEAKERS.
			<br>
			All any of them knew was that I had a torn hip (which I do) and had a noticeable limp. Somehow the connection in their minds wasn’t made between having an injury (Or MS, or also MS) and the need to wear low heels or flats or sneakers, for that matter.  I got a few of the classic stares…you know the one where they start with your head and move their eyes up and down and up again and a few “oh that makes sense” from the more gracious ones of the group and a few “wow, that’s a drag that you can’t wear cute shoes”.  Oh honey, you have no idea.
			<br>
			I felt shattered.  I was always one of the ones that was pretty put together.  Even on a bad day. Here I was looking shabby and feeling even more shabby inside.   At first I decided that I would just stay home next time (not productive) or that I would just suffer in shoes that looked good but weren’t functional (not possible).  Honestly, I would have to plant myself firmly in a wheelchair or scooter to get around in my pretty shoes and they don’t work so well on all of the stairs leading up to the kind of houses we have in London, which are beautiful indeed, but not easy to navigate with a disability.
			<br>
			So what to do?
			<br>
			Well at first I did stay home and it wasn’t fun.  I am an extrovert and that spelled disaster for my sense of well-being.  I rationalized it by saying that I would go out and be more adventurous if/when my leg started cooperating, but so far, that hasn’t happened.  So what I needed to change was my mindset (and some of my friends) both of which have been quite rewarding, although I am still not going out as much as I would like.  We are all works in progress, so as long as we are progressing, well, we’re headed in the right direction.
			<br>
			SHOWING UP means different things to different people, but for me, part of that, second of course to having meaningful and caring interactions with the ones I love, is caring enough not to look so bedraggled that they start to really worry.  I also have started to really work the casual chic thing and it’s just amazing that sneakers are so “in” this year. I LOVE them and they have so many cute styles that work well with all kinds of outfits. I have been trying to curate this and it really makes me feel better to get out, show up in a way that is true to myself and enjoy friends and family and be happy with the photos at the end of the fun!  We all have different challenges with MS, but in ways big and small, it is still possible to look good, which in my experience leads to overall well-being. It doesn’t take a huge budget or a huge wardrobe…we can all be FashionABLE. A big shout out to Ardra at www.trippingonair.com.   She always manages to look FAB (and she is unbelievably funny).
			<br>
			I’d love to hear your fashion hacks with MS!
			<br>
			A few of my favorite things…cashmere capes, ponchos and sweaters never go out of style…frayed hem jeans, loafers and flats with arch support, clutches, wristlets…dresses with low or flat boots that go over the knee or booties if you can’t wrestle the high boots over uncooperative feet and calves
			<br>
			Vionic Caballo Flats (arch support and comfy footbed) they manage to make anything look chic
			<br>
			Schai Vita snood (in photo)…fits over your shoulders and is cozy and cool
			<br>
			Sam Edelman booties
