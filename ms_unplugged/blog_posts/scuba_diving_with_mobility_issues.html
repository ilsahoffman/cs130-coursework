			Around the time my husband and children developed an interest in scuba diving, I was busy having an MS attack that would limit my mobility.  I didn’t recognize what it was at first, as I had never in the 18 years of having MS experienced a motor attack. It had all been sensory; pins and needles, optic neuritis, little seizures where I couldn’t write my name legibly…you know, relatively minor as far as MS symptoms go.  Not to mention, I had been relapse-free for eleven years and I thought I was in the clear.
			<br>
			Clearly not.
			<br>
			So even though my family encouraged me to join in, I was in denial about what was going on with me and also for the first time in my life, didn’t feel that I could trust my body. What if I get dizzy? What if I can’t bear the weight of the oxygen tanks? What if, what if, what if…until I just wasn’t willing to try it. Then, like a true ostrich, I buried my head in the sand (very profoundly, I might add) and SAT at my desk, not working out, not walking further than I had to, just hoping the whole thing would go away.
			<br>
			Which it didn’t. Clearly, something had to change.
			<br>
			So this husband of mine, who is a very persistent, encouraging kind of guy started to work out ways that I could scuba dive without having to worry about all of the things I had used as excuses not to do it.
			<br>
			“I don’t really want to” YES YOU DO!
			<br>
			“I might fall over on the boat and knock myself out with the oxygen tanks”  I”LL HOLD ONTO YOU!
			<br>
			“The tanks may be too heavy” YOU CAN PUT THEM ON IN THE WATER!
			<br>
			“I can’t flip upside down without getting dizzy” YOU CAN STEP IN!
			<br>
			“I might panic, I won’t feel safe, it’s too scary…blah blah blah”  until I was just exhausted from listening to my own excuses and can only imagine how he felt.  Then I convinced myself I would be happy to watch him and our four children jump off the boat and go below and just bask in the sun waiting for them to come back up…NOPE, it wasn’t working, and I felt sorry for myself and deprived.  This sideline life is not what I had envisioned for my travel and adventure-loving self and my attitude was getting to be a downer.
			<br>
			So I decided to give it a go!  We went to Antigua, and my guy spoke to the dive company about making modifications so that I could do it.  I did my pool session with the lovely Pats from Indigo Divers (www.indigo-divers.com) who was patient and really believed in me, and all was going well until we got to the open water part of the dive.  The wind picked up, and the water started to white cap but no matter! I jumped in and tried for about 30 minutes and attempted to go under, but my hair was getting all tangled up in the mask, causing it to flood, then  cut my arm on the bottom of the boat and was finally just too exhausted to keep trying and this is where I THOUGHT my scuba diving efforts had ended.
			<br>
			Remember that persistent person I was mentioning?  Almost a year later he sauntered up to me at the pool in Costa Rica and told me he had it all arranged that I could try again from the beach.  My teenagers and adult children had absolutely giddy looks on their faces, so much so that it was impossible for me to come up with another excuse, so I didn’t.  
			<br>
			Emmanuel from Deep Blue Diving (www.deepblue-diving.com) went through a refresher of all of the things I learned in the pool in Antigua then we did two open water dives. I put all of the gear on in the water while holding onto him for balance.  The tank was light in the water, and it was no strain whatsoever on my body. With the fins on my feet, I felt like a fish! It was absolutely exhilarating! Not that on those first two dives we saw much of interest, mostly just a few scattered fish and a white sandy bottom, but the feeling of being free underwater, without the uncoordinated leg getting in my way was just great!   The next day we went again, and I got down to 12 meters. We saw coral, schools of fish, anemones and flute fish. The feeling of the water pressure was also amazingly calming, and I felt great!
			<br>
			Now I am looking forward to our next FAMILY scuba diving trip and feel proud of myself for actually doing it because as we all know, excuses aren’t that fulfilling.
			<br>
			So, as far as learning to scuba dive with mobility issues, I have a few suggestions.
			<br>
			Safety is key.  Only do it if the CERTIFIED  dive company fully understands your limitations and are willing to work around them.  I have found that divers are usually so enthusiastic about the underwater world and the preservation of it, that they are happy to make it accessible for those who want to do it.  If you can spring for a private session with a divemaster for your first few dives, it might give you that extra boost of confidence that helps you to keep trying.
			<br>
			Have the right equipment and make sure it all fits properly.  A mask that is always filling with water or a regulator that is too hard to breathe through will not set you up for a successful experience.
			<br>
			Do your research well in advance.  Communicate with the dive shop wherever you are going and make sure you both have clear expectations of how it is going to go down.  Thorough planning will help to prevent disappointment and wasted money.
			<br>
			Being successful at this has made me more confident again.  I want to challenge myself to do more adventurous activities, and my perspective is no longer “I can’t do this” but “how CAN I do this?” Having friends and family to support you is vital, but no one can make you do anything. It has to be your desire.
			<br>
			Until next time,
