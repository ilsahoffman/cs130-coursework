			I am loving this organization and am feeling noticeably better following their recommendations. Find out more here.
			<br>
			“Overcoming MS (OMS) educates, supports and empowers people with MS in evidence-based lifestyle and medication choices that improve health outcomes. OMS is a global nonprofit organization that is registered as a charity in the USA, UK and Australia.”
			<br>
			“The OMS Recovery Program has one core mission: to help people with MS live longer, better and have healthier lives. Through a series of diet and lifestyle changes – all based on rigorous scientific research and evidence – we believe people with MS can make a dramatically positive impact on their quality of life.”
			<br>
			“The program consists of the following: diet, exercise, stress management, sunlight, vitamin D and omega-3 supplementation, and, when needed, medication.”
