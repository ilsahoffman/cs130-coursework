			I have to admit, that at first, I was RESISTING getting crutches.
			<br>
			Easy to understand, of course, why would anyone want to give in to using crutches, when just weeks before they were nothing I had ever considered! Suddenly, an invisible illness becomes visible and for me, it was time to tell my friends.  It was all so hard!
			<br>
			I was also dreading the silver crutches that look like they came out of a hospital, not great for me as a fashion statement or as something I was going to have to look at indefinitely.  
			<br>
			My sweet husband researched and found my high tech Ergo Baum crutches and basically insisted that I use them, and they have been a real life saver, at least “face-saver” for when I go out and don’t know how long I will have to stand or how far I will have to walk.  I can manage fairly short distances, but after 10 minutes, all of the swerving starts, and my muscles knot up like softballs. Fun!
			<br>
			I will mention that they are NOT cheap, but the performance on these babies is amazing.  They come with all of the bells and whistles and although I could have never imagined thinking that a flashing light on a set of crutches would be something I would care about, it does make you feel much safer crossing streets in the dark at a tortoise’s pace.  No offense, Tortoise, it’s just me!
			<br>
			They have a spring that is really natural that helps with your gait and a knee rest if you have to stop and take a break.  The arm cuffs leave your hands free to open doors without the crutches hitting the deck and the handles are cushioned and comfortable.  I will say that they are slightly heavy (not as light as aluminum) but overall, the pros well outweigh the cons.
			<br>
			While I am still in a bit of a personal struggle of accepting them, I’m impressed with how they are made, how they look and overall performance.  I guess you could say I’m a reluctant fan, through no fault of their own.
