			I am not a doctor.  Repeat. I am not a doctor.  I’m just passing along something that has CHANGED my life.  Please speak to your own doctor about what will work best for you.
			<br>
			After getting my first infusion of Rituxin for the treatment of  RRMS, I started getting at least 3 migraine headaches a week. Many of them lasted at least two days, so you can see where this is leading, as far as quality of life!  I’m not sure the headaches and the Rituxan are related but… I went to my doctor and was prescribed a strong pharma to prevent headaches and a strong pharma to knock it out of the park if I got one.  The problem was that between the two, I always felt super foggy and completely unreliable in the thinking department, so after three doctors, one finally said to me “You know, maybe you should try Riboflavin, I’ve heard that it can help with Migraines”, so in a hopeful, yet skeptical frame of mind, I rushed home (rushing being a matter of interpretation) and ordered it to be delivered the following day.
			<br>
			I have not had a Migraine since.  That was almost three weeks ago! I am thrilled with this, as now I can contribute to conversations without losing my train of thought due to strong drugs, nor do I make my family sit in a dark and quiet room if they want to be with me (which to be honest, they probably didn’t!  Not sure it is fun for anyone to have a great time with someone holding their head in their hands and complaining ad nauseum). I take 400mg a day and that does the trick for me!
			<br>
			Fingers crossed this continues…now if it were only so easy to get rid of some of these other annoying symptoms!
			<br>
			Do you have any hints to help with headaches or some of the other issues we MSers have to deal with?  Please share!
			<br>
