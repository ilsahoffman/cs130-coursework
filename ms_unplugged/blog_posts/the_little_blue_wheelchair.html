			Yes, that’s  the one I’m talking about.  Wow. I never thought I would need one of those, but recently it has become glaringly apparent that if I want to be able to live as normally as possible, it is an absolute necessity.
			<br>
			A big thank you to the State of Vermont!
			<br>
			My life in Central London didn’t make it  obvious that I would need one. Part of this is due to my heroic and failed attempts to fake being fine and just staying home if I felt my faking wasn’t going to make it. (I don’t encourage this…it didn’t work and only made me lonely and sad).   Life this past year has been full of door to door taxis that made it so easy to forget my current limitations. Everyday errands? No problem, I sussed out all of the most efficient ways to my gym, my bank, my children’s schools, my favorite lunch spots.  BUT… as I headed back to the US to spend my summer, the long walks from the hinterlands of parking garages and endless asphalt lots, I suddenly realized that the leg just doesn’t cooperate the way it used to! Hamstrings, hip flexors, quadriceps, all on the right side, just freeze up and leave me stranded and then, of course, the ensuing anxiety and terror of being stuck doesn’t help either.  
			<br>
			This is where the little blue placard comes in.  I can’t tell you how overjoyed I was to be granted one, although the words “permanent condition” and “no expiry date” gave me real  pause. In a way, it was a relief to stop fighting the simple things, the “I should be able to do this if I just try harder” and “If I work out more maybe it will get better”.  I absolutely don’t plan on changing my optimistic outlook on MS or stopping my DMD’s, my Wahl’s protocol food program, my exercise routine or supplements but having a convenient place to park makes the tasks I used to take for granted so much easier.  Going to the grocery store shouldn’t feel like climbing Mt. Everest and being bitchy to my family because of exhaustion is not ok!
			<br>
			Let me know how you feel about the little blue placard…or other ways you have found to help yourself get around and live life to the fullest.
