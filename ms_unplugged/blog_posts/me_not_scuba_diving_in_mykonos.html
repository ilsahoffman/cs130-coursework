			Me, NOT Scuba Diving in Mykonos

			Don’t let that smile fool you. A good hat and cool shades only go so far…
			<br>
			Truth be told, I’d rather be in a photo squeezed into a wetsuit, a little burnt, hair a little wild, but here’s the thing.
			<br>
			I’ve lost confidence in my body.  I was the girl who could ride big horses with happy confidence, swim with the kids in the ocean, hike up Machu Picchu and shop all day in Paris carrying shopping bags. I could even move furniture around in my house if I really wanted to change it up.  Now I can barely carry my own purse and I’m constantly worried about face-planting on the sidewalk in front of the neighbors.<br>
			When did this happen?
			<br>
			Not that MS has a pretty side, but this is definitely one of the uglier aspects of having an unpredictable, debilitating and chronic disease; this loss of confidence in all things that used to come SO easily that I took them for granted.  
			<br>
			Walking, for instance.
			<br>
			I look around me now and see people walking with friends, running with dogs and skipping along merrily and all I can think is “I used to be able to do that, I hope they know how lucky they are!” and it gives me a twinge of regret mixed with a big dose of self-pity. I’m reminded to feel grateful and “focus on the things I can do”, BUT…
			<br>
			This is not so easy.  It is a learned task. It takes some practice and self discipline for me not to feel jealous about the physical abilities of other people, especially those that are my age.  All of my friends are constantly talking about running ½ marathons, hiking up big mountains (what a view!) and learning to surf on vacation. Which brings me to my latest challenge, scuba diving.
			<br>
			Everyone in my family has become passionate about scuba diving and when I say passionate, I mean absolutely consumed with everything about it…all of the sea creatures and coral, the turquoise blue water, the peaceful feeling of being underwater…and they all want me to join in.  I’m finding it really hard to explain why I am so afraid to try this new thing. It’s true, I am still a good swimmer, I am with-it enough to figure out the myriad of equipment and how it works and the water is usually a pretty ideal temperature. They’ve figured out how to get me in the water without having to carry the big, heavy tanks and hired an instructor just for me so that I feel safe.
			<br>
			But I don’t.
			<br>
			I want to scuba dive.  I want to do more than just look at Go-Pro videos of their adventures but my loss of confidence seems elemental and I am really struggling with how to overcome this fear so that I can join in the fun and not just ride along on the boat.  Any ideas?
