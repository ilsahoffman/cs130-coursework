			I am not being paid to tell you how much I LOVE this thing!<br>
			On their website, https://theragun.com/products/g2pro, they say that it “increases lymphatic flow and reduces lactic acid” and “helps relieve muscle fatigue, soreness, spasms and stiffness”…ok that sounds like a prescription for what ails me, so I decided to risk spending the $599 on it to see if it really works.
			<br>
			I was not disappointed.  With forty percussions per second, 4 placement angles and 4 different attachments, this baby hits every area of muscle spasticity and pounds it out in just a few minutes, as opposed to the time that it takes for me to manually get them loosened.  I use it several times a day, mainly after exercise or if I’ve been sitting at my desk or in the car and the improvement is really noticeable and makes a real difference in my ability to move.
			<br>
			I highly recommend you add this to your MS fighting arsenal if you can.  I first saw one at my physiotherapist’s office and was able to give it a mini-trial and I imagine many physical  therapists and MS neuros will have this in the coming months. Hope this helps you as much as it has helped me! Happy Hammering!
