			I should start by saying that the full and complete destruction of my new Tom Ford sunglasses was just a tiny mishap on a day that was otherwise quite glorious.  A beautiful Autumn day climbing, in a rather ungainly fashion, into a beautiful mahogany hacker with my fabulous sisters and our husbands for a boat ride around Lake Placid to celebrate my Mother’s 70th birthday.  With a few helping hands I made it to my cushy forest-green leather seat and off we went, snacking on canapes and sipping champagne. The lake was indeed, placid. A mirrored reflection of sunset skies and trees adorned in their gorgeous shades of red and gold. The boat sped away and we laughed and in that moment, I felt fabulously normal (I’m sure the few glasses of bubbly helped!)  It made me forget almost wiping out on the way to our lakefront cabin because of the pathway so uneven that it almost seemed to be by design. Maybe the more uneven, the more authentic? It made me forget that look of sadness in my Mother’s eyes when she saw me limping more than last time she saw me and how I couldn’t carry my own purse because I flouted my own rule of only carrying wristlets and cross-body bags so that I could reasonably catch myself without bashing my face in (so far, so good).  Purses are another topic altogether. My sunglasses looked FAB. So cute and stylish and big and black and just AWESOME. I needed them on the boat that evening because they kept my fragile eyes from the glare that gives me vertigo and well, if you haven’t gotten this yet, I just loved them. Loved, past tense.
			<br>
			When the fun cruise was over,  I was trying to gracefully remove myself (again with several helping hands) and the cushion that they had to protect the lovely leather seats from shoes slipped when I stood on it, causing my other leg to scramble wildly, which became even wilder because somehow said sunglasses had fallen beneath my feet in all the ruckus and created the perfect ice rink for me to flail on.  My darling husband’s stomach and belt buckle provided the uncomfortable cushion for my face, which miraculously did not get a scratch. Thanks honey! The gradient lenses, the frames and the arms were all casualties of the war to get out of the boat, as a matter of fact, I can’t imagine how they could have been destroyed more…maybe if I had tossed them in a bonfire!
			<br>
			We all laughed so hysterically that again, I almost fell over, but it was a cathartic end anyway.
			<br>
			This leads me to think of some of the other things I’ve lost or had to give up because of this bad beast…high heels (one woman’s loss is another woman’s gain…my sister now has an amazing shoe wardrobe), horses (again, another post, I’m not willing to count this as completely out yet), straight walking strolls in the park…but then it also makes me grateful for the things I might not have noticed…like how my sweet husband is always there to do his damn-well best to keep me from falling in and out of restaurants, planes, trains and automobiles, how my friends handled the whole revelation better than I imagined, how my sisters treat me like I’m completely fine and the bossy mother hen I’ve always been.  I appreciate all of the help I never would have asked for before, even if I really needed it, and for my very lucky quiet MS when my four children were small and for the amazing and supportive bunch they have become.
			<br>
			So all in all, I’m ok and those Tom Ford’s?  They’ve been replaced by something better…
