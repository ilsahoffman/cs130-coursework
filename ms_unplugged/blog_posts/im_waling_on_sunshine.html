			Today was a big day.
			<br>
			I voluntarily left the safety and security of my cozy home and headed to the PARK.  Yes, that’s right, the PARK.
			<br>
			No I wasn’t alone, it wasn’t dark and I wasn’t under the influence of one too many glasses of champagne.
			<br>
			I was always confident in this body of mine.  That doesn’t mean I always loved the way I looked or didn’t get aches and pains when I went to the gym or lifted heavy boxes or carried a child on each hip around Disney World.  What it does mean is that I was always sure that it would do it’s job.  After all, I am from a family of strong women who could fend for themselves…
			<br>
			Until, well, you know, it stopped cooperating and then I stopped working with it and decided that if I just RESTED, it would all be fine and dandy and I would be back to my old over-doing-it antics in no time.  This isn’t how it has worked out for me and if I’m totally honest,  for one year I have been a real hermit.  I have  chosen to stay in, which for an extrovert like me really isn’t healthy or fun or positive.  In retrospect (the metaphorical long winter is over) I think I needed to process several things that were making me sad (my first two children going to college in another country) and resolve things that were causing me a lot of stress (me not looking after myself or my mental state).  By staying in, I had time for Pilates at home three times a week, I made riding my stationary bike a priority and worked with my TRX straps.  I also started to meditate and began to work with an EFT(Emotional freedom technique, better known as Tapping) practitioner to work out some childhood traumas.
			<br>
			Several times, my neurophysio practically dragged me outside, but the rush of fear and anxiety was so strong that by the time I got back inside, my heart was pounding and my legs were as stiff as tree trunks.  I wasn’t ready.
			<br>
			BUT, last night, after many successful social encounters where I didn’t wipe out or fall downstairs, I decided it was time to properly re-join the living and I texted my Pilates teacher and asked if we could go to the PARK instead.  She said “yes!” and the rest is why I am so happy today.  I walked with my ByAcre rollator at least one kilometer through tress of orange and gold and paths with runners and babies and dogs and felt truly happy, like REALLY, TRULY HAPPY and only  had to sit down once.  I wasn’t hard on myself for going slowly and I just enjoyed and appreciated the fact that I was walking outside in nature and it was GREAT.
