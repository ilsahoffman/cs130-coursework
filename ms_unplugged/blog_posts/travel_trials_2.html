			So my latest mission is to perfect getting through the airport stress-free.  So far, my attempts have ranged from fairly decent to fairly awful, but I think I’m getting there!  Here goes with the list of do’s and don’ts for my level of disability which includes the fairly consistent inability to walk distances or a straight line  or carry anything more than a wristlet without help! Furious crying has also occurred on occasion when someone else’s ineptitude or lack of common courtesy  foils my grand plans and my mascara!
			<br>
			<bold>
				Do’s
			</bold>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Carry only the necessities on the plane.  For me, this is an IPad mini (good for books, movies, podcasts and notes), ONE lipstick (not the five I am usually carting around), my passport and currency all in this handy little pouch (it has 4 zip pockets, so you can carry multiple currencies, cards, passport all in one place). www.sjwbagslondon.co.uk/products/sjw-wellington-wallet-black I also carry a little bag with all of my meds in it as I usually get big headaches on planes, headphones (I prefer my big Bose noise-cancelling ones) especially on overnight flights, and of course, my two  phones (UK and USA) and my silk eyepatch (saves the makeup so you don’t arrive looking like Cruella Deville.
				</li>
				<li>
					Request assistance as needed, IN ADVANCE.  This being said, I have found airport assistance to be unreliable and largely non-existent for all intents and purposes at some European airports, so always arrive early and be prepared to be demanding.  If they offer assistance, I believe it should be efficient and timely, but then again, having realistic expectations and being emotionally prepared can be helpful for reducing the furious tears mentioned above.
				</li>
				<li>
					If possible, bring your own mobility device. My favorite is this one,  https://www.byacre.com and a big shout out to https://www.trippingonair.com for the recommendation.  Whether a rollator that folds up nicely and has a cover to be gate checked or crutches (which they will generally put in a closet on the plane itself), I have found it much more reliable to get myself from curb to gate to curb and a lot less frustrating.  I give myself plenty of time, take my “walking drug” and depending on how I’m feeling take rests along the way. I also bring my folding cane so that when they take everything at security to xray it, I can make it through the scanner without falling over.
				</li>
				<li>
					Don’t be in a rush to get off of the plane, you’re going to get through customs before anyone else anyway if you use the lines for those with disabilities mentioned below.  I have found that people in a rush to get off the plane will mow you down without a second thought in their mad dash to get wherever they are going and if your plane happens to have a set of stairs attached to it for disembarkation, it is downright terrifying. This is really common in the Caribbean and  your margarita will still be there, I promise. If you need to get in and out of the plane with wheelchair assistance, make sure that you let them know. They have lifts that raise to the galley so that you don’t have to fall down the stairs to get to the tarmac.
				</li>
				<li>
					Use the special lines for those with disabilities when you go through customs. The lines can be very long and you have every right to use them even if you have an invisible disability. I have used them with or without my mobility aids and noone has ever questioned me.
				</li>
				<li>
					Make use of the porters if you are traveling alone. There is no way I can manage my suitcase and my rollator or crutches, so spend the few dollars and make your life easier. If I’m traveling with my five lovelies, it’s all taken care of, but I often make trips by myself and it saves a lot of frustration and energy.
				</li>
				<li>
					Dress comfortably but stylishly if you can muster it. Comfortable shoes are an absolute must and a cute LITTLE bag, backpack or wristlet is key.
				</li>
				<li>
					Bring a  good attitude and some good ol’ courage to help you get to that place you’ve been dreaming about and don’t let the difficulty take away from the fact that you are actually DOING it.  So much better than staying home, as nice as that is.
				</li>
				<li>
					Hydrate at opportune times. Bring healthy snacks.
				</li>
				<li>
					Study the seating plan on the airplane. I find that bulkheads are best. More legroom makes up for the fact that everything has to be put in the storage compartments for take-off and landing.
				</li>
				<li>
					Did I mention champagne? Sorry Paleo.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<bold>
				Don’ts
			</bold>
			<ol>
				<li>
					Don’t wing it. This is a surefire way to a bad start to your trip. PLAN, PLAN, PLAN.
				</li>
				<li>
					Now is not the time for magazines and heavy books. I used to use airport time to catch up on all of the glossy fashion magazines and home design magazines. They are much more fun in print, but these can be downloaded and you’ll save yourself at least five pounds.
				</li>
				<li>
					Don’t try to do more at the airport than you do at home. I’ve found that the added anxiety and exertion is a guarantee that my legs are going to seize up. Take it easy, ask for help and remember that Rome wasn’t built in a day.
				</li>
				<li>
					Don’t carry your entire toiletry bag on the plane unless you are happy to part with that expensive face cream or perfume.
				</li>
				<li>
					Don’t dress impractically. Remember that you have to basically disrobe at security so make it easy on yourself and wear something that is easy to manage and shoes that are easy for you to take on and off. No lace-up Gladiator sandals!
				</li>
				<li>
					Don’t expect airline employees, airport workers and anyone else you encounter to completely understand your needs by telepathy.  Be clear, be polite and keep your cool. I know it isn’t so easy when children are weaving between your legs and no one seems to see you, but this is a real curse of the able-bodied…they seem to have no understanding of the difficulties we face on every step of an air journey.  Try to be patient, as you will be the one that is still seething after a family with five teenagers takes up all of the seats on the airport train while you’re standing there with your crutches, and then basically runs you down on the way to their gate. Is it aggravating? Yes.  Is it wrong? Yes! But only you have control over your own mindset and for me, it just isn’t worth getting monumentally HACKED.
				</li>
				<li>
					Don’t be late.  If you have requested assistance or need more time, you can’t expect anyone else to make up for the fact that you showed up with little time to spare. Not to mention you won’t have time for the aforementioned champagne.
				</li>
				<li>
					Don’t be silent. If things go wrong at the airport, complain in writing and expect an answer. If you don’t get an answer, complain higher up. Most airlines don’t want bad reviews and truly intend to do right by all of their customers.  When they fail, let them know.
				</li>
			</ol>
			Do you have any suggestions to make air travel easier?  If so, I would love to hear about it!

			More on hotels, resorts and other means of travel soon!  Happy traveling! x
