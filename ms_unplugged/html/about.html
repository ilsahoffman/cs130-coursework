						I was diagnosed with MS in 1998 when my first child was two years old. It was a scary time. I had a myriad of symptoms that no one could explain which caused me massive anxiety and regular meltdowns. The first symptom that could be identified as possible MS was Optic Neuritis, a common affliction in those with MS. I immediately was put on IV steroids and recovered most of my eyesight in the affected eye but went on to have many attacks of ON over the course of the next few years. I was told that I was ‚Äúlucky‚Äù because most of my symptoms were sensory and that was a good sign. I tried all of the Disease Modifying Drugs at the time (there were only 3) but didn‚Äôt stay with any of them very long, because they made me feel like a ‚Äúsick person‚Äù and aside from the Optic Neuritis, I didn‚Äôt feel sick or fatigued at all. Flash forward twenty years and I had an attack that I didn‚Äôt even recognize as an attack which affected my right leg and has made me feel sick and tired quite a bit. I am now on a new drug(one of 18!) that is to help reduce relapses and help remyelinate, so I‚Äôm hopeful!
						<br>
						This blog is my effort to overcome Multiple Sclerosis and share my lifestyle tips, life hacks and experiences as someone with MS. I want to help you realize that you can still do most of the things you want to, maybe with a little extra planning, but the world is still your oyster! We are stronger together and a little fashion and sarcasm can‚Äôt hurt either üôÇ
						<br>
						I love design, travel, plant-based nutrition and exercise and my London lifestyle. I hope you will join me! I know when I was diagnosed I felt alone and terrified of my future and I don‚Äôt want anyone else to feel that way!
						<br>
						I‚Äôm still standing and I hope you will join me x
